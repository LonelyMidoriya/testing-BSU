[Intro]
Are you alright?
I'm alright, I'm quite alright
And my money's right
8â€¦ (Yeah)
Countin' them bands
All way to the top 'til they be fallin' over
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Countin' them bands
On my way to the top 'til we fallin' over

[Chorus]
I don't really care if you cry
On the real, you shoulda never lied
Shoulda saw the way she looked me in my eyes
She said, "Baby, I am not afraid to die"
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge

[Verse 1]
Phantom that's all red, inside all white
Like somethin' you ride a sled down, I just want that head
My Brittany got mad, I'm barely her man now
Everybody got the same swag now
Watch the way that I tear it down
Stackin' my bands all the way to the top
All the way 'til my bands fallin' over
Every time that you leave your spot
Your girlfriend call me like, "Come on over!"
I like the way that she treat me
Gon' leave you, won't leave me, I call it that Casanova
She say I'm insane, yeah
I might blow my brain out (Hey)
Xanny, help the pain, yeah
Please, Xanny, make it go away
I'm committed, not addicted, but it keep control of me
All the pain, now I can't feel it
I swear that it's slowin' me, yeah
[Chorus]
I don't really care if you cry
On the real, you shoulda never lied
Saw the way she looked me in my eyes
She said, "I am not afraid to die" (Yeah)
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge (Yeah)
All my friends are dead, yeah, ooh
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead, yeah
All my friends are dead, yeah
